**DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED**
 In a pipelined processor design, the goal is to improve the overall performance of the processor by breaking down the instruction execution into several stages, allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously. Here's a general description of the tasks involved in designing a pipelined processor:

**Instruction Fetch (IF)**: The first stage of the pipeline is the Instruction Fetch (IF), where the instruction is fetched from memory. The Program Counter (PC) is used to point to the current instruction's memory address. The fetched instruction is then passed to the next stage for decoding.

**Instruction Decode (ID)**: The Instruction Decode (ID) stage decodes the instruction to determine what operation needs to be performed. The processor identifies the source registers, decodes the opcode, and determines control signals for subsequent stages.

**Execution (EX)**: In the Execution stage, arithmetic or logic operations are performed on the data. This is where the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) performs operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or comparison. For branch instructions, this stage calculates the target address.

**Memory Access (MEM)**: In the Memory Access (MEM) stage, if the instruction involves accessing memory (such as loading data from memory or writing data to memory), it is carried out in this stage. For load or store instructions, memory is read or written to accordingly.

**Write Back (WB)**: The final stage in the pipeline is the Write Back (WB) stage, where the result from the execution or memory stage is written back to the register file. This ensures that the result of the operation can be used by subsequent instructions.

**Pipeline Hazards and Forwarding**: A) Data Hazards: Occur when instructions that are close together depend on the same data. These can be resolved through techniques like data forwarding or stalling the pipeline. B) Control Hazards: Arise from branch instructions, which can disrupt the flow of instructions. Branch prediction and delay slots are techniques to handle control hazards. C) Structural Hazards: Happen when hardware resources are insufficient for executing multiple instructions simultaneously, which may require adjusting the pipeline structure or adding more resources.

**Pipeline Optimization Techniques**: A) Data Forwarding (Bypassing): Allows the processor to forward data directly from one stage to another, bypassing certain stages to avoid unnecessary delays. B) Branch Prediction: Improves the handling of branch instructions by guessing the outcome of branches to keep the pipeline filled. C) Pipeline Stalling: Temporarily halting the pipeline to resolve data hazards or control hazards, such as when a result isnâ€™t ready in time.

**Performance Improvements**: Pipelining significantly increases throughput by allowing multiple instructions to be in various stages of execution simultaneously. However, the overall performance improvement depends on the efficiency of handling hazards and the specific architecture of the processor.

**CONCLUSION**: Pipelined processor design enables efficient parallelism, with different stages of instruction processing operating simultaneously. This approach reduces the overall time required to process instructions, making it an essential design principle in modern processors. However, the design also requires handling various hazards and complexities to ensure that the pipeline operates smoothly and efficiently.
